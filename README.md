This is the initial version of a custom component for Home Assistant to manage one or multiple SAX batteries.
To install, copy the files in the custom components folder and use the UI to add the new integration.
During setup, you will be asked to provide a smartmeter interface and a power factor measure.
For now, you will get the actual power reading of each battery pack and the SOC.

Work in progress for switches, further sensors and battery management.
